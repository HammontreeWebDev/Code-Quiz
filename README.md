# Code-Quiz

## Description
An application intended to test students' knowledge of various coding subjects. The user will receive a score at the end of the quiz and compete to rank themselves at the top of the leaderboard.\
The current state of the quiz is unfinished. I created a logic error in the JavaScript file by having the code hiding and unhiding elements, instead of emptying them out and storing them to local storage. There is also a bug in the code causing the penalty to be enforced if the previous buttons answer was also false. Re-orginazation  of code is also needed. Although, I can read it. I'm not sure anyone else can, easily. I (think) I know what needs to be done, but I ran out of time before the deadline.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0

```
